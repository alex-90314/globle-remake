## My attempt at recreating [Globle](https://globle-game.com/).

Globle is a game where the `"goal is to guess which country it is using the fewest number of guesses. Each incorrect guess will appear on the globe with a colour indicating how close it is to the Mystery Country. The hotter the colour, the closer you are to the answer."`

In my recreation, I kept the basic premise of guessing the mystery country but simplified it by using a command-line interface instead of a 3D color GUI
